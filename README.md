## Deep Learning Models for Classification, Regression, and Image Classification

This project consists of three deep learning models implemented in separate Google Colab notebooks. These models solve different problems:

1. **Classification Model**  
2. **Regression Model**  
3. **Image Classification Model**

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Per class metrics for multi-class classification.
- **ROC Curve**: To evaluate the performance across all thresholds.
- **PR Curve**: Precision-Recall curve for imbalanced datasets.
- **Per Class Examples**: Visual examples of predictions with their ground truths.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To examine how the classifier is misclassifying each class.
